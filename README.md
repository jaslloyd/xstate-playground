# XState Playground

A UI can be in various states, loading, error, idle etc a State machine allows us to model a UI in all these states. A state machine is a finite set of states that can transition to each other deterministically due to events. A statechart is an extension of state machines; mainly, they can have:

Hierarchical (or nested) states
Orthogonal (or parallel) states
History states
